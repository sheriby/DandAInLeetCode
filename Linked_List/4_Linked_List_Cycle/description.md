# From LeetCode 141. [Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)

## Description

*Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.*

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed)Â in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.


## Example1

> **Input**: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1  
>
> **Output**: true  
>
> **Explanation**: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.

## Example2

> **Input**: head = [1, 2], pos = 0  
>
> **Output**: true  
>
> **Explanation**: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.

## Example3

> **Input**: head = [1], pos = -1  
>
> **Output**: false
>
> **Explanation**: TThere is no cycle in the linked list.
